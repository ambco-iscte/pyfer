## Context
This library was developed as the final project for an elective
[Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://fenix-mais.iscte-iul.pt/courses/04193-565977905365459) 
course as part of the 
[Master's (MSc) in Computer Engineering](https://www.iscte-iul.pt/course/12/master-msc-in-computer-engineering) 
programme at [Iscte-IUL](https://www.iscte-iul.pt/).

## Acknowledgements
We kindly thank Dr. Mohammad H. Mahoor, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Denver, 
and M. Mehdi Hosseini, Ph.D. Student of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Denver, for providing 
us with the [AffectNet](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/) dataset to aid in the development of our facial 
expression classification model.

We kindly thank Dr. Jeffrey Cohn and Megan Ritter from the University of Pittsburgh for providing us with the 
[Cohn-Kanade dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5543262) and its extended version to aid in the development 
of our facial expression classification model.
